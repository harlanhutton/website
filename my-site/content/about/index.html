<p><b>Fun Facts:</b></p>

<p>Outside of graduate school, I am a musician. 
 My band Harlan has toured all over the country 
(we were even awarded grants to do so). I am also an avid runner, 
 and I've run the St. Jude half marathon 6 times so far. 
 I love to cook for family and friends and my favorite TV show 
right now is Succession. One of my favorite jobs I've ever 
had was working at MemPops, a popsicle food truck in Memphis! 
 I worked all through college until covid and still miss it.
Quarantine hobbies include knitting and the NYT daily crossword. </p>
