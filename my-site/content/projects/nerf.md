This paper, my first first author paper, was presented at the 2023 NeurIPS 
Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences workshop.

ABSTRACT: Image coaddition is of critical importance to observational 
astronomy. This family of methods consisting of several processing 
steps such as image registration, resampling, deconvolution, and 
artifact removal is used to combine images into a single 
higher-quality image. An alternative to these methods that are built 
upon vectorized operations is the representation of an image 
function as a neural network, which has had considerable success in 
machine learning image processing applications. We propose a deep 
learning method employing gradient-based planar alignment with 
Bundle-Adjusting Radiance Fields (BARF) to combine, de-noise, and 
remove obstructions from observations of cosmological objects at 
different resolutions, seeing, and noise levels -- tasks not 
currently possible within a single process in astronomy. We test our 
algorithm on artificial images of star clusters, demonstrating 
powerful artifact removal and de-noising.
